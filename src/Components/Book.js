                    Kevin Maloney is a veteran of the construction industry
                    whose love of mathematics led him to develop an absolutely
                    unique numerical product which is being used by individual
                    applications of education, entertainment, research,
                    cognitive health, and as a user interface security product.
                    Mathematical fluency allows the author to analyze complex
                    real-world issues and clearly focus on objective
                    understanding of these global issues. The product Your
                    Number Guaranteed is creating a global community, through
                    social media, of thoughtful members who are improving their
                    lives and those around them. <br />
